Conclusions
1)	On average, you have roughly the same chance at success as you do failure/cancelation with a campaign. 53% success rate and 46% failed or were canceled
2)	While theater is the most prevalent field for a campaign, you have the highest chance of meeting your goal if you are running a campaign supporting music with restaurants and journalism giving you the lowest change at a successful campaign
3)	As an overall average, the time of year for a campaign doesn’t seem to have a large impact on its success or failure though April and May do show the best results with December showing the worst. That being said, trend lines for success and failure vary widely between categories so you would be well served to do market research dependent on your field to gain any real relevance from the data

Limitations of dataset
•	It references a limited number of campaigns with extremely small sample sizes outside the US and UK. In many cases there are only single digit or double digit counts of campaigns
•	A strong reference point of what the end results are being sought
•	If there was successful launches of the campaigns


Other possible tables/graphs
•	A combination of two showing the categories with sub-categories
•	A look at categories and sub-categories by time
•	Correlations of staff picks to success rate
•	Correlation of number of backers to success rate
•	Correlation of average donation to success rate
